# Data Engineering Journey ðŸš€

Welcome to my journey as an aspiring Data Engineer! This repository serves as a space to track my progress, explore new technologies, and share what I learn along the way.

## About Me
I have worked on Data Warehouse projects, developing ETL pipelines, optimizing structured BigQuery queries for performance and memory efficiency, implementing business rules, and restructuring legacy BigQuery procedures that handle critical business data and complex logic.

## Goals & Learning Path
As a Junior Data Professional, my goal is to continuously improve my engineering skills by building and testing solutions that enhance my learning experience.

Currently, I am focusing on:
- **Python & PySpark** for data processing
- **Cloud Data Solutions**, including data pipelines and storage
- **Databricks & Data Lakehouse Architecture** for scalable and efficient data management

## Why This Repository?
This space is a hands-on learning hub where I experiment, document insights, and track my evolution in data engineering. If you're also on this journey, feel free to explore and collaborate!
